# Writing-ALgorithm
How basically an algorithm is created, a simple instance of finding similar movies and item based collaborative filtering is being taken.In this repository step by step with the data of around 10000 movies and than using packages pf python like numpy, pandas(GroupBy, PivotTable) which will help in sorting, merging and other detailed view which is with in the code.Also, at last the item based collaborative filtering is done by correlation between the similar movies.This repository basically help beginner user in data science field while writing an algorithm as it used only basic libraries of python but conceptual of understanding an algo will be created.
Note: Go sequentially, first by similar movies and than with item based collaborative filtering code. Also, data of movies can be taken from any movies rating sites e.g. IMDb in the form of csv file.
